# Gene Enrichment Analysis

## Introduction

-   Gene enrichment analysis identifies biological pathways or functions that are overrepresented in a set of genes of interest.

## Methods

-   Fisher's exact test calculates the probability of observing a set of genes in a pathway by chance, based on a contingency table of gene counts.
-   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) compares the distribution of a gene set's expression values to the distribution of all gene expression values in a dataset to determine whether the gene set is overrepresented.
-   Other methods include the hypergeometric test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and CAMERA.

## Tools and Databases

-   Ensembl BioMart, AnnotationHub, and the DAVID database are available for obtaining gene metadata.
-   R is a popular programming language for performing gene enrichment analysis.
-   R packages include ClusterProfiler, DOSE, and fgsea.

## Conclusion

-   Gene enrichment analysis is a powerful method for identifying biological pathways or functions that are overrepresented in a set of genes of interest.
-   With the availability of tools and databases, as well as R packages for performing analysis, gene enrichment analysis is becoming increasingly accessible to researchers in various fields.
